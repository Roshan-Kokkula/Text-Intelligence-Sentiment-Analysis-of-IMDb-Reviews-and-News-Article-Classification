# Text-Intelligence-Sentiment-Analysis-of-IMDb-Reviews-and-News-Article-Classification
PART A  
The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning classification model that
can predict the sentiment of IMDb movie reviews. The dataset contains a collection of movie
reviews, and each review is labeled as either positive or negative.  
PART B  
The primary objective of this project is to build a classification model that can automatically
categorize news articles into different predefined categories. The model will be trained using
a labeled dataset of news articles and will output the most likely category (e.g., sports,
politics, or technology) for any given article.
